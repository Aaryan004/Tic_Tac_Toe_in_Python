# Tic_Tac_Toe_in_Python
Welcome to my interactive Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python!

Game Rules:
- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns to place their symbol ('X' or 'O') in an empty cell.
- The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.

Getting Started:
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Run in any IDE of your choice.

Player Input:
- Enter your moves by specifying the row and column numbers, separated by a space.

  Example:

  Enter Input, Player 1: 1, 2 
- If a player enters the co-ordinates of an already filled cell, he/she will be informed that the cell is filled and will be asked to specify another cell.


Winning the Game:

- The game ends when a player achieves a winning combination.
- The winner's name will be displayed.
